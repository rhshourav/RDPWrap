The goal of this project is to enable Remote Desktop Host support and concurrent RDP sessions on reduced functionality systems for home usage.

RDP Wrapper works as a layer between Service Control Manager and Terminal Services, so the original termsrv.dll file remains untouched. Also this method is very strong against Windows Update.

### Attention:
It's recommended to have original termsrv.dll file with the RDP Wrapper installation. If you have modified it before with other patchers, it may become unstable and crash in any moment.

### Information:
- Source code is available, so you can build it on your own
- RDP Wrapper does not patch termsrv.dll, it loads termsrv with different parameters
- RDPWInst and RDPChecker can be redistributed without development folder and batch files
- RDPWInst can be used for unattended installation / deployment
- Windows 2000, XP and Server 2003 will not be supported

### Key features:
- RDP host server on any Windows edition beginning from Vista
- Console and remote sessions at the same time
- Using the same user simultaneously for local and remote logon (see configuration app)
- Up to [15 concurrent sessions]
- Console and RDP session shadowing 
- Full [multi-monitor support]

### Porting to other platforms:
- **ARM** for Windows RT (see links below)
- **IA-64** for Itanium-based Windows Server? *Well, I have no idea* :)

### Building the binaries:
- **x86 Delphi version** can be built with *Embarcadero RAD Studio 2010*
- **x86/x64 C++ version** can be built with *Microsoft Visual Studio 2013*
